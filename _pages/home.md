# About

## My Research

I explore virtual galaxies and their surroundings, and use my explorations to give insight on how these massive structures form.
Take a look through my [visualizations](/visualizations/), [publications](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/\#/public-libraries/fyuwUPLzSAihgQ4PDhtDdQ/), or [code](https://github.com/zhafen/).

## Me

I am a doctoral candidate at Northwestern University, where I work with [Claude-André Faucher-Giguère](http://galaxies.northwestern.edu) as a member of the [FIRE project](https://http://fire.northwestern.edu/).
When I'm not working on research I spend a lot of time [teaching](/teaching/).
