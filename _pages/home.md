## About Me

I am the McCue Prize Postdoctoral Fellow at UC Irvine, working primarily with [Dean James Bullock](https://sites.uci.edu/bullock/) on the astrophysics of galaxies.
I am currently exploring opportunities in data science, finance, consulting, software development, or other fields beyond astrophysics.

Highlights of my work include
* using natural-language processing to analyze hundreds of thousands of scientific abstracts,
* leading an interdisciplinary, international collaboration to test the robustness of statistical methodology, and
* processing tens of TB of (3+N)-dimensional data using HPC resources.

Take a look through my [visualizations](/visualizations/), [resume](https://zhafen.github.io/assets/ZacharyHafenSaavedra.pdf), [publications](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/\#/public-libraries/fyuwUPLzSAihgQ4PDhtDdQ/), or [code](https://github.com/zhafen/), or [email me if you have a question](mailto:zachary.h.hafen@gmail.com).
