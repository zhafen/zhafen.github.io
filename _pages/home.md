## My Research

I explore virtual galaxies and their surroundings, and use my explorations to give insight on how these massive structures form.
Take a look through my [visualizations](/visualizations/), [publications](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/\#/public-libraries/fyuwUPLzSAihgQ4PDhtDdQ/), or [code](https://github.com/zhafen/), or [email me if you have a question](mailto:zachary.h.hafen@gmail.com).

## Me

I am a doctoral candidate at Northwestern University, where I work with [Claude-André Faucher-Giguère](http://galaxies.northwestern.edu) as a member of the [FIRE project](https://http://fire.northwestern.edu/).

When I'm not working on research I spend a lot of time teaching high school students as a [Reach for the Stars fellow](http://gk12.ciera.northwestern.edu/).
I am currently working with [the Northwestern Academy for Chicago Public Schools](https://www.academy.northwestern.edu/) to create [vault](https://avault.github.io), a place for high school students to answer in-depth questions about the world around them.
