## About Me

As the McCue Prize Postdoctoral Fellow at UC Irvine, I study the astrophysics of galaxies with [Dean James Bullock](https://sites.uci.edu/bullock/).
I am now actively seeking opportunities in the fields of data science, finance, consulting, and software development.
My proven track record of
analyzing complex data sets and building high-performing analysis pipelines in cloud environments,
combined with my exceptional skills in science communication and experience in leading interdisciplinary and international collaborations,
makes me a valuable asset to any team.
Some relevant aspects of my work as an astrophysicist include:
* using natural-language processing to analyze hundreds of thousands of scientific abstracts
* processing tens of TBs of 20+ dimensional data for numerous analysis projects
* leading an interdisciplinary, international collaboration to test the robustness of statistical methodology
