    title: "This cosmic flower was not grown in nature, but by astrophysicists using supercomputers. At the center of the flower a simulated galaxy shines in bright yellow. The galaxy is surrounded by multi-colored petals, each consisting of many smaller lines. These lines are actually the paths through the universe traced by gas that will form the galaxy and its environment. The petal shape is caused by the expansion of the universe itself followed by a gravity-induced collapse into the galaxy. The colors represent gas from different origins: the blue gas spirals into the galaxy from the vast space between all galaxies, the green gas blasts from the center of the galaxy as titanic winds, and the orange and red gases are the paths traced by satellite galaxies as they smash through the surroundings. This image was co-created with Alex Gurvich, and won both second place and the people's choice award in the 2018 Northwestern Scientific Images contest."

    title: "This collection of images show gas swirling around the same galaxy in several different ways. Taken together, the columns create a time-lapse projection. The top row shows the density of gas in the galaxy at a given time: in these panels, the brightest areas show where gas is most densely concentrated. In the middle row, gas shoots out of the galaxy in the bright areas and plummets toward the center of galaxy in the darkest areas. The bottom row shows temperature: the brighter the area, the hotter the gas. This image was a finalist in the 2016 Northwestern Scientific Images contest."
